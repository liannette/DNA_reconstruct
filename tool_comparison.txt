 --qualitymax ~
 --collapse
 --minlength 1
 --adapter1 {ADPT1}
 --adapter2 {ADPT2}
 --file1 {input.s1}
 --file2 {input.s2}
 --basename {params.out_prefix}
 --seed {SEED}
 --minalignmentlength 10

Parameter explaination:
    --file1 FILE [FILE ...]
        Input files containing mate 1 reads or single-ended reads; one or
        more files may be listed [REQUIRED].

    --file2 [FILE ...]
        Input files containing mate 2 reads; if used, then the same number of
        files as --file1 must be listed [OPTIONAL].

    --threads THREADS
        Maximum number of threads [default: 1]

    --qualitybase BASE
        Quality base used to encode Phred scores in input; either 33, 64, or
        solexa [default: 33].

    --qualitymax BASE
        Specifies the maximum Phred score expected in input files, and used
        when writing output. ASCII encoded values are limited to the
        characters '!' (ASCII = 33) to '~' (ASCII = 126), meaning that
        possible scores are 0 - 93 with offset 33, and 0 - 62 for offset 64
        and Solexa scores [default: 41].

    --minlength LENGTH
        Reads shorter than this length are discarded following trimming
        [default: 15].

    --collapse  
        When set, paired ended read alignments of --minalignmentlength or
        more bases are combined into a single consensus sequence,
        representing the complete insert, and written to either
        basename.collapsed or basename.collapsed.truncated (if trimmed due to
        low-quality bases following collapse); for single-ended reads,
        putative complete inserts are identified as having at least
        --minalignmentlength bases overlap with the adapter sequence, and are
        written to the the same files [default: off].

--shift N
        Consider alignments where up to N nucleotides are missing from the 5'
        termini [default: 2].

--minalignmentlength LENGTH
        If --collapse is set, paired reads must overlap at least this number
        of bases to be collapsed, and single-ended reads must overlap at
        least this number of bases with the adapter to be considered complete
        template molecules [default: 11].

bbmerge:
" in1={input.s1}"
" in2={input.s2}"
" out={output.m}"
" adapter={ADPT_FILE}"
" t=1"
" mininsert=1"
" mininsert0=1"
" minoverlap=10"
" k=10"

t=1                  Number of Threads
minoverlap=12        Minimum number of overlapping bases to allow merging.
k=31                 Kmer length.  31 (or less) is fastest and uses the least
                     memory, but higher values may be more accurate.  
                     60 tends to work well for 150bp reads.
minq=9               Ignore bases with quality below this.
maxq=41              Cap output quality scores at this.
qtrim=f              Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.
                     Trims BEFORE merging.
                     Values: t (trim both ends), 
                             f (neither end), 
                             r (right end only), 
                             l (left end only).
