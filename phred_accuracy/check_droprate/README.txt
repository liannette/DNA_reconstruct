This workflow investigates how many reads are merged at different 
quality levels. For this, 100,000 fragments of length 120 are generated 
and reads are simulated at different quality levels:

Quality shift       max phred quality score
      0                         38
    -10                         28
    -20                         18
    -30                         8
